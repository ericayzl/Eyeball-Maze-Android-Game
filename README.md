# Eyeball-Maze-Android-Game
Try to solve this puzzle game I created based on the Eyeball Maze Game logic that already exists. (The eyeball can only land on tiles with the same colour and shape, moving horizontally or vertically. The eyeball cannot move backwards. Reach the goal within the move count to win the game!)
