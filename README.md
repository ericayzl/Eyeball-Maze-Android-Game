# Eyeball-Maze-Android-Game
Try to solve this puzzle game I created based on the existing Eyeball Maze Game logic. (The eyeball can only land on tiles with the same colour or shape, moving horizontally or vertically. The eyeball cannot move backward. Reach the goal within the move count to win the game!) Only the MainActivity.java and the model code (containing the logic I created for the eyeball maze game) are provided. Please feel free to contact me if you want to try the game.
